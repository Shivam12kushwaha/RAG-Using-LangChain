### Text Splitting is a process of breaking large chunks of text like articles,PDFs,HTML pages or books into smaller, managable pieces(chunks) that an LLM can handle effectively.

## Overcoming model limitations:
#### Many embedding models and language models have maximum input size constraints. Splitting allows us to process documents that would otherwise exceed these limits.

## Downstream Tasks:
#### Text Splitting improves nearly every LLM powered task.

## Length Based Splitting:
#### In langChain, Lenght Based Splitting is handled by the CharacterTextSplitter class or its variants where you can define how long each chunk of text should be. This is especially useful when working with large documents that need to be processed by language models with taken or character limits.
