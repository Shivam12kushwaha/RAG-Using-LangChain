### A Vector Store is a system designed to store and retrieve data represented as numerical vectors.
## Key Features:
### (1) Storage:
#### Ensures that vectors and their associated metadata are retained, whether in-memory for quick lookups or on-disk for durability and large scale use.
### (2) Similarity Search:
#### Helps retrieve the vectors most similar to a query vector.
### (3) Indexing:
#### Provide a data structure or method that enables fast similarity searches on high-dimensional vector(eg., approximate nearest neighbour lookups)
### (4) CRUD Operations:
#### Manage the lifecycle of data adding new vectors, reading them updating existing entries, removing outdated vectors.
### Use Cases:
#### Semantic Search, RAG, Recommender System, Image or Multimedia Search.
